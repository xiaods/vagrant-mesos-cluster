vagrant-mesos-cluster
=====================

A vagrant configuration to set up a cluster of mesos master, slaves and zookeepers through ansible

# Usage

Clone the repository, and run:

```
vagrant up
```

This will provision a mini Mesos cluster with one master, one slave, and one
HAProxy instance.  The Mesos master server also contains Zookeeper and the
Marathon framework. The slave will come with Docker installed. 


# Deploying Docker containers

After provisioning the servers you can access Marathon here:
http://100.0.10.11:8080/ and the master itself here: http://100.0.10.11:5050/

Submitting a Docker container to run on the cluster is done by making a call to
Marathon's REST API:

First create a file, `ubuntu.json`, with the details of the Docker container that you want to run:

```
{
  "container": {
    "type": "DOCKER",
    "docker": {
      "image": "libmesos/ubuntu"
    }
  },
  "id": "ubuntu",
  "instances": "1",
  "cpus": "0.5",
  "mem": "128",
  "uris": [],
  "cmd": "while sleep 10; do date -u +%T; done"
}
```

And second, submit this container to Marathon by using curl:

```
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" http://10.0.10.11:8080/v2/apps -d@ubuntu.json
```

You can monitor and scale the instance by going to the Marathon web interface linked above.
